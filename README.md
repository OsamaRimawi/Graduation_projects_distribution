# Graduation_projects_distribution
 Genetic algorithms to build a “Graduation projects distribution” program. 

Developing a Graduation projects distribution is not an easy task. It has many variables: Students, Supervisors, Topics and selection order. The aim of this project is to distribute the topics based on the student’s selection as much as possible. One of the common approaches to solve this problem is using CSP or Genetic algorithms.  

Therefore, the aim of this project is to use Genetic algorithm to optimize the distribution of the graduation projects topics based on the student’s selection order. The input for this project is as follows: 

    File  (Student’s selection) contains the student’s selection. The file contains the students’ names, and selection order where the first choice is the most preferable. The number indicates the project number (see the second file)

    File contains projects topics, where the first column indicates project number used in the first file.
