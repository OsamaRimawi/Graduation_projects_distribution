# Graduation Projects Distribution Program

Welcome to the repository for the "Graduation Projects Distribution" program using Genetic Algorithms.

## Overview

Developing a graduation projects distribution system involves managing various variables such as students, supervisors, topics, and selection orders. This project aims to optimize the distribution of graduation project topics based on students' selection orders using Genetic Algorithms, a popular approach for such optimization problems.

## Project Structure

- **`/AI_Project`**: Contains the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm for project distribution.
- **`/project report.pdf`**: Detailed project report, including algorithm explanation and usage instructions.


## Input Files

- **`students_selection.csv`**: Contains students' names and their project selection orders.
- **`projects_topics.csv`**: Lists project topics, with project numbers corresponding to the selection orders in the first file.
